# LD2410D-B BLE Integration

A Home Assistant integration for the HiLink LD2410D-B Bluetooth motion sensor.

## Overview

This integration provides support for the **HLK-2410D-B** and **HLK-LD2410B** Bluetooth motion detection sensors in Home Assistant. These sensors detect both moving and static targets, providing distance and energy measurements for advanced motion detection automation.

## Features

- **Motion Detection**: Real-time detection of moving targets (MOTION sensor)
- **Occupancy Detection**: Static occupancy detection (OCCUPANCY sensor)
- **Distance Measurement**: Moving and static target distance in centimeters
- **Energy Levels**: Target energy readings for both motion and static detection
- **Gate-based Configuration**: 9 configurable detection gates for motion and static detection
- **Bluetooth Discovery**: Automatic device discovery via Bluetooth
- **Local Push**: Real-time updates via local Bluetooth connection

## Supported Models

- **HLK-LD2410B** - Original model
- **HLK-LD2410_*** - HLK variant
- **HLK-2410D-B** - New D-series model

## Installation

### Manual Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Copy the entire folder to your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory:
   ```
   <config>/custom_components/ld2410_ble/
   ```
3. Restart Home Assistant
4. Go to Settings → Devices & Services → Create Automation
5. Search for "LD2410 BLE" and follow the setup wizard

### HACS Installation

To be added to HACS once published.

## Configuration

The integration uses Bluetooth discovery. Simply add your device through the Home Assistant UI:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
2. Click **Create Automation**
3. Search for **LD2410 BLE**
4. Select your device from the discovered list
5. Complete the configuration flow
